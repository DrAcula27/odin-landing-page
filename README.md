<strong>The Odin Project - Foundations - Flexbox - Project: Landing Page</strong>

<p>The goal of this project is to clone a landing page website using HTML and CSS. The Odin Project provided a <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/odin-project.png">design</a> and a <a href="https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/foundations/html_css/project/colors_and_stuff.png">style guide</a> for fonts and colors.</p>

<strong>After completing this project, I will have accomplished:</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Becoming more comfortable and fluid with version control using Git and GitHub</li>
    <li>Improving understanding of the CSS Flexbox model</li>
    <li>Implementing a webpage design based on an image (simulated client needs)</li>
